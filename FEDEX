FedEx Corporation, after its inception in 1997, has been provid-ing services in four different segments: FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx Services. FedEx has not just marked its presence in transportation and communication but has also been considered as one of the world’s most employee-friendly companies. The company is regarded as among the 100 ‘Best Companies to Work for’ in the US.
Innovative HR practices with open door policy and fair treatment procedure at FedEx make the company being loved by its em-ployees and set a benchmark for other companies in the industry. The HR practices of the company include ‘People-Service-Profit’, ‘Survey-Feedback-Action (SFA)’ program and ‘Leadership Evalu-ation and Awareness process’ (LEAP). The ‘People-Service-Profit’ policy is based on a philosophy that if employees are well taken care, they provide effective services in return; thereby making the business earn more profits. The SFA program at FedEx is a key employee relations and satisfaction program.
Apart from this, at FedEx, an online survey is carried out once in a year. The results of the survey are discussed with employees regarding the satisfaction and dissatisfaction factors outside and within the organisation. The LEAP program has been designed to encourage non-managerial employees to move to the manage-rial level. In this way, the company promotes in-house movement within the hierarchy.
